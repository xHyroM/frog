Frog lang is extremely simple language based on Monkey language

- I used a implementation of monkeylang in rs by @wadackel under MIT
  - https://github.com/wadackel/rs-monkey-lang

- Implementations:
  - the entire monkey language
  - tasks (something like fn but with name)
  - string, int, bool, char, arrray, hashmaps (data types)
  - len, print, typeof, bash (built-in functions)
