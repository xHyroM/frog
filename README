Frog lang is extremely simple language based on Monkey language

- I used an implementation of monkeylang in rs by @wadackel under MIT
  - https://github.com/wadackel/rs-monkey-lang

- Implementations:
  - user-specified functions using keyword `fun X() {  }`
  - string, int, float, bool, char, arrray, hashmaps (data types)
  - len, print, typeof (built-in functions)
